# (2) Edits to design:

- Logo (Citizen Budget title): It's a tiny bit too big, can you make it a couple sizes smaller?
- Subheadings: Can you change the font for the subheadings for each section to differentiate them more from the Citizen Budget title logo?
- “Demo” and “Quote” buttons: remove the arrows
- Sections: the order is wrong, it should be 
Tagline
Description
About
Features
Quotes
Logos. 
See below for Overview. 
- The "Overview" section: 
We've narrowed it down to 9 points instead of 12 (see document) 
How are we incorporating all the descriptions for each point? 
Might be putting this section on a completely separate page (see (3))
- Client logos: instead of a slider, we'd like two static lines of logos, with the logos bleeding off the page on each side. Without having the slider, what is the maximum amount of logos we can fit on two static lines? (I'm thinking 8 to 10?) I'll provide you with the final logos once I know how many we can include.
- Back to the top: We'd like to include a "Back to the top" arrow for each subheading, any suggestions as to what that could look like? Maybe a small arrow pointing up in a circle?


# (3) Things that still need to be decided on internally:

There are internal discussions going on for the following points, but I thought I'd give you a heads up and see if you had an opinion on any of them.

- The "Overview" section: initially this was supposed to be on a separate page, but we're currently deciding on whether we will still want it separate or on the main page like it is now. Will this affect how we will incorporate all the descriptions for each point? 
- Contact forms: We have three contact forms right now (one for "Request a demo", one for "Request a quote" and one for "Contact). We might be condensing it all into one, I'll keep you posted. 
- Benefits of online budget consultations: There's supposed to be a tab at the top for this, but I think it'll be too crowded so we might replace "Sign up for a webinar" with "Benefits of online budget consultations". Any suggestions?
- The "About" section: I don’t like the way it looks right now. I think it needs more spacing, larger letters, etc. just to clean it up a bit and make it clearer. We're editing the text for it now so you can wait until that's finalized before making any changes. 


I'm aiming to get you the final decisions for (3) this week, but the points in (1) and (2) are ready to be implemented right away. I know there's been a lot of back-and-forth and change requests that were made that were probably a waste of time and not very efficient (all our fault!). I'm really hoping to reduce this for the final leg of the project, but thank you for being so good about everything! After these edits, I expect the next mockup you send me to be the near finalized version of the website, with maybe some minor edits here and there for fonts, etc. 

A few other questions:

- We have a newsletter coming out December 17th and we were hoping that we could have the website up and running for that time, is that possible (I know it's only 10 days). 
- How many iterations of the website do you typically allow within a regular budget? ie. how much is it costing us per mockup?
- And also what kind of timeframe are we looking at for beta testing?

Again thanks so much for being so quick at everything and for all the work you've done so far, it's looking really amazing. I'll be available until 4:30 today, if you can give me a call. If not, I might have a free minute around 10:30am tomorrow.  

Let me know if you have questions for any of these!

Thanks,
Laurence
