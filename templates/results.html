                <p>For their 2012 budget, the borough of Plateau Mont-Royal in Montreal held an online budget consultation. The easy-to-use and interactive system allowed residents to add, remove and modify services until they balanced the budget, at which point they could submit it for consideration. After the consultation, the borough mayor, Luc Ferrandez, presented the local budget to the public and explained how citizens' input directly influenced the borough's decisions. The online consultation reached more residents while costing 90% less than previous traditional consultations.</p>

                    <p>Apart from the civic election, no other activity in municipal government has as much impact on the life of our city than the annual budget process. The City of Edmonton strives for an open government where citizen engagement is of paramount importance, and Citizen Budget has helped us advance this goal.</p>
